Now trying to generate HTML5 slides from Markdown using: Pandocs.

Still there's quite a lot of manual copy-paste required, and:

> No live preview. (for now...)

Anyway manual work for now is good to familiarize with (to even know)
what you need, and automate it next time.

<iframe class="frame" width="700" height="600" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;" src="/theme/slides/secondslides/embedder.html#slides.html">
</iframe>

#### Success!

More placeholder text here...

And even more here.
