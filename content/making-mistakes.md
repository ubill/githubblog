#### Making mistakes

We learn faster if we are allowed to make mistakes; just do something,
see what happens from there, and use the feedback to help us in
moving forward.

If we're too concerned with **"getting everything perfect before getting started"**,
just imagine if we had this mindset when learning how to walk as babies[^babies] -
we'd never get moving.


[^babies]: Of course, mistakes that result in babies ;) are another story
altogether.
