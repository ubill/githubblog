Right now I'm using this lightweight online WYSIWYG Markdown editor,
**StackEdit**[^stackedit] to help me write the posts here.

[^stackedit]: [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) is a full-featured, open-source Markdown editor based on PageDown, the Markdown library used by Stack Overflow and the other Stack Exchange sites.
